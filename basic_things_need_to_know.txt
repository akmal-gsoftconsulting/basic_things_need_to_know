==================================(installation of ubuntu on window)============================
	WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) â€“ Install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store via PowerShell:
	wsl --install -d Ubuntu



=================================================(serverless ??)=================================
What is Serverless Computing?
No need to manage or provision servers.
Auto-scaling based on demand.
Pay only for execution time (not idle time).

======================================(configure and deploy by sls)=============================

To deploy using Serverless Framework (SLS):  
1. Ensure AWS Credentials are Set (for AWS):
   sls config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_AWS_KEY --secret YOUR_AWS_SECRET
2. Deploy Your Service:
   sls deploy
3. Verify Deployment:
   sls info
4. Remove Deployment (If Needed):  
   sls remove

=================================================(AWS??)========================================

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is a cloud computing platform by Amazon that provides on-demand services 
like computing power, storage, databases, networking, AI, and security. It enables businesses to scale
 without managing physical servers, offering a pay-as-you-go pricing model. ðŸš€
